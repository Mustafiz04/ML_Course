NumPy is a Linear Algebra Library for Python, the reason it is so important for Data Science with Python is that almost all of the 
      library in the PyData Ecosystem rely on NumPy as one of their main building blocks.
  
NumPy is also incredibly fast, as it has binding to C library

It is highly recommended you to install Python using the Anaconda distribution to make sure all underlying dependencies 
      (such as Linear Algebra liberies) all sync up with the use of a conda install

If you have Anaconda, install NumPy by going to your terminal or command prompt and typing          
                
                        conda install numpy
                         pip install numpy
                         

NumPy arrays are the main way we will use NumPy throughtout the courses.
NumPy arrays essentially come in two flavours: Vectors and Matrices.
Vector are strickly 1-D arrays and Matrices are 2-D (but you should note a matrix can stil have only one row or one column)
